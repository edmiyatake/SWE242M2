Write a program that will count the number of lines in each file that is specified on the command line. Assume that the files are text files. Note that multiple files can be specified, as in "java LineCounts file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt". Write each file name, along with the number of lines in that file, to standard output. If an error occurs while trying to read from one of the files, you should print an error message for that file, but you should still process all the remaining files.

HOW TO USE

Make sure to change java file to class file
- javac M2.java

To check the amount of lines in a file
- java M2 <filename1> <filename2> etc.
